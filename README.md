AIS : Alumni Interactive System

As students of Epoka University, we have noticed that the number of students enrolled per year has increased significantly in the last 
3 years. According to Career Planning and Alumni Office, the number of graduates is currently 1700 and is expected to be around 3500 by 2020. 
Considering that Alumni data is kept manually by the Career Office using spreadsheet softwares, a major problem is that all these data
will soon become extremely difficult to collect, maintain, distribute and update. Furthermore, statistical analyses would be hard for the
Career Office to generate and also to help the in the decision making process of the Board of Directors of Epoka University. 

The main purpose of this project is to digitalize alumni information into a well-structured management system integrated with a social 
network that will help the Career Office and the students themselves to communicate and share their professional background. In addition, 
this network will help the Career Office better organize gathering events for graduated students.

This management system will have two main modules:


1. The admin module
   
   In this case, the Career Office representative will take the role of the administrator of the system with the following functionalities:
  
  a. Create new alumni student profiles and/or events
  
  b. Read the information from the database
  
  c. Update the events and/or the alumni data
  
  d. Delete irrelevant information on th system
  
  e. Generate and view statistics
  
2. The alumni student module
   
   In this case, every student successfully graduated from Epoka University can be part of AIS using his/her Epoka email address.
   
  a. Create his/her own profile
   
  b. View his/her profile 
   
  c. Add job postings
 
  d. Update his/her information
  
  e. Respond to events and/or job listings
