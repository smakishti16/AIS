AIS : Alumni Interactive System

As students of Epoka University, we have noticed that the number of students enrolled per year has increased significantly in the last 
3 years. According to Career Planning and Alumni Office, the number of graduates is currently 1700 and is expected to be around 3500 by 2020. 
Considering that Alumni data is kept manually by the Career Office using spreadsheet softwares, a major problem is that all these data
will soon become extremely difficult to collect, maintain, distribute and update. Furthermore, statistical analyses would be hard for the
Career Office to generate and also to help the in the decision making process of the Board of Directors of Epoka University. 

The main purpose of this project is to digitalize alumni information into a well-structured management system integrated with a social 
network that will help the Career Office and the students themselves to communicate and share their professional background. In addition, 
this network will help the Career Office better organize gathering events for graduated students.
